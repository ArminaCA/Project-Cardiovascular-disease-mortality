# Increasing our understanding of Cardiovascular disease mortality risks and relationship with Social determinants.

In this project, our team chose two datasets namely USA 2018 census and Cardiovascular disease data.  We merged datasets using Jupyter Notebook, the The dataset was carefully cleaned and prepared  for deeper analysis and visualization.

Our main goal was to investigate the relation between social factors and the mortality rate from cardiovascular disease. Social determinants are elements that are known to affect health outcomes, such as income levels, education, employment, access to healthcare and more. We intended to identify any potential connections or patterns between these variables by combining the cardiovascular disease data, which contains mortality rates, with the census data, which has information on other social determinants.

In order to acquire understanding of the relationship between the mortality rate from cardiovascular disease (Coronary heart disease and Stroke) and social variables (i-e. income, age groups, education level) ,we used data analysis and visualization techniques in Jupyter Notebook. This involved performing statistical tests (Linear Regression & T-test), looking at relationships, and generating visualizations like histogram plots, bar charts and scatter plots. 

With the help of our exploratory analysis, we aimed to answer research questions such as: Does a higher income level correspond to a lower cardiovascular disease mortality rate? Are areas with better access to healthcare associated with lower mortality rates? How does educational attainment relate to cardiovascular disease mortality within different age groups and states.

Our findings will help in advancing understanding regarding how social determinants affect cardiovascular health outcomes. Policymakers, healthcare workers, and researchers may be able to use the knowledge gathered from this project to design targeted interventions and policies that would lower mortality rates from cardiovascular disease as well as improve population health.


# EDA Analysis:
# Findings from Visualization of the distribution of income levels across different states:
From the visualization of the distribution of income levels across different states. We were able to do comparisons between states and reveal a pattern in income distribution across the dataset. The ascending bars showed the range of state average income values, indicating that different states had a varying income level. States with lower bars indicated relatively lower average incomes, while states with higher bars represented relatively higher average incomes. The New Jersey (NJ) and Connecticut (CT) states had the highest bars on the graph that indicated these states had highest average income levels. Whereas Mississippi (MS) state was with the lowest bar and represented that it had lowest average income levels. The differences in bar heights revealed the disparities in income distribution across the states within USA. A significant variation in bar heights suggested a larger income disparity between the highest and lowest average incomes among the states. This indicated the presence of income inequality within the dataset. The lowest average income level state MS had $38,350.88 as income and the highest average income level state NJ had $83,854.97 average income.

# Findings and Interpretation from Visualization of Degree Type:
We had categories the educaction level into two categories namely "HS degree and below" and "Above HS degree". The bar chart of degree type showed almost two equal ditribution. Data set had sample with almost equal percentage of people with High school degree & below comparison to people with who had above high school degree. We inferred that data was normally distributed among the these two degree types as the mean and median of each degree type is almost same.

# Findings and Interpretation from Visualization of the Stacked Barplot for Average Mortality per 100K by both Disease Types and Age groups:
The purpose of the stacked barplot visualization was to  better comprehend the pattern of average state mortality. The mortality count from both type of heart diseases (CHD and Stroke) and across all age groups in each state were graphically shown in the stacked barplot. Death rates in a state can be affected by a number of factors, and we learned more about these influences by analyzing the distribution.

The analysis makes use of a dataset detailing state-level mortality rates per 100,000 residents. The rows of the dataset reflect the 50 states and the columns represent the two type of heart diseases and age categories (35-64 years and 65+ years). Specifically, we used stacked barplots, where each bar represents a state and was further subdivided into segments for each disease category and age group. Upon visualizing the stacked barplot of average state mortalities, several key observations were made:

**Disease Type Contributions:** The vertical segments within each state's bar indicated the contributions of different disease types to overall mortality. The varying lengths of the segments reflected the relative impact of specific diseases in different states. The leading cause of mortality was by Coronoary heart disease (CHD) among 65+ years across all the states and followed by Stroke in the same age group.

**Age Group Patterns:** The color variations observed within each disease type category correspond to distinct age cohorts. Through an examination of the chromatic composition within individual segments, it was possible to gain insight into the variations in mortality rates among distinct age cohorts. The data visualization provided evidence that 65+ years age group people had more mortality by both heart disease type.This data had the potential to illuminate age-related vulnerability and inform focused interventions or healthcare measures. Hence, Centre of Disease control (CDC) should focus their research on how to prevent heart diseases among this group and what could be the possible causes other than age such as lifestyle, eating habits, finanical or emotional stress.

**State Mortality Comparisons:** The comparison of state mortalities can be made by analyzing the heights of the bars, which allowed for the identification of variations in average mortality rates across different states. States with higher overall mortality rates were represented by higher bars such as Arizona (AR), Oklahoma (OK) and Tennessee (TN); whereas lower bars of states such as Massachusetts (MA) and Colorado (CO) indicated relatively lower average mortalities. This comparative analysis offered valuable insights into the regional disparities in mortality rates, thereby indicating the need for targeted interventions and additional research in particular geographic regions.
