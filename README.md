# Increasing our understanding of Cardiovascular disease mortality risks and relationship with Social determinants.

In this project, our team chose two datasets namely USA 2018 census and Cardiovascular disease data.  We merged datasets using Jupyter Notebook, the The dataset was carefully cleaned and prepared  for deeper analysis and visualization.

Our main goal was to investigate the relation between social factors and the mortality rate from cardiovascular disease. Social determinants are elements that are known to affect health outcomes, such as income levels, education, employment, access to healthcare and more. We intended to identify any potential connections or patterns between these variables by combining the cardiovascular disease data, which contains mortality rates, with the census data, which has information on other social determinants.

In order to acquire understanding of the relationship between the mortality rate from cardiovascular disease (Coronary heart disease and Stroke) and social variables (i-e. income, age groups, education level) ,we used data analysis and visualization techniques in Jupyter Notebook. This involved performing statistical tests (Linear Regression & T-test), looking at relationships, and generating visualizations like histogram plots, bar charts and scatter plots. 

With the help of our exploratory analysis, we aimed to answer research questions such as: Does a higher income level correspond to a lower cardiovascular disease mortality rate? Are areas with better access to healthcare associated with lower mortality rates? How does educational attainment relate to cardiovascular disease mortality within different age groups and states.

Our findings will help in advancing understanding regarding how social determinants affect cardiovascular health outcomes. Policymakers, healthcare workers, and researchers may be able to use the knowledge gathered from this project to design targeted interventions and policies that would lower mortality rates from cardiovascular disease as well as improve population health.
